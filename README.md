# Tell Me A Story
This little project is an introduction to input and Javascript

A single page (index.html) has 
<ul><li>style in the head</li>
    <li> a form in the body</li>
    <li> an output div</li>
    <li> two javascript functions in the script tag </li>
        <ol><li> A reset function</li>
        <li>A function which generates a story</li>
        </ol>
</ul>

<br>

# Challenge

Add extra inputs and modify the code to output a story when the submit button is pressed.

This will be added to your portfolioi later... but is a stand alone assignment for the time being.

# Development

You can look at the different form input fields at w3 schools.
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp if you want to explore more than text inputs.

You could modify this to be a Mad Lib kind of game.

Feel free to modify style and colour as you like.
